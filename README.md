# PoetryCode
The main project code

# Sprint 2 Test Cases
1. The user should be able to click the boxes on the instructor dashboard to view student statuses on each poem
    
 - Tested this feature by clicking on all of the dummy data students we have currently in our app and verifying that their progress matches up with the progress that we have in our dummy database.


2. The user should be able to click a poem on the poem dashboard to link to the corresponding gameboard page

  - First, we navigated to the student dashboard. Then we clicked on Sonnet 4. We verified that the poem name and text were correct. We then verified that the poem key was correct by playing the game.


3. The user should be able to navigate the site with the navbar
  
  - To test this, we clicked on each link in the nav bar and noted that it took us to the correct page.


4. The user should be able to check their work against the answer key.
  
  - To test this, we loaded up Sonnet 4. We input the correct answer on the gameboard (which is alternating red and blue) and noticed that we got a “Correct!” alert. Then, we deleted a row, and noted that we got the expected output, which was an “Incorrect” alert when we clicked the submit button


5. After a user logs in, they should be taken to their student dashboard

  - We tested this by logging in with a username and password, and noted that the login button did indeed take us to our student dashboard.


# Sprint 3 Test Cases
1. The interface should be easily navigable by a new user.

  - We clicked around the nav bar to make sure that it navigated to the correct pages.

2. Should be able to click the button at the top of the instructor dashboard to see an alternate view.

  - Verified this by clicking the button and making sure that the view was updated correctly.

3. A link on the student dashboard should take users to a poem to be scanned.

  - Verified this by clicking on a poem and verifying that the poem text and key were the ones in our dummy database.

4. The login form should take the user to their dashboard on submission.

  - Verified this by clicking the log in button and verifying that the page was changed to the correct dashboard.

5. The register form should require all fields except for the instructor email.

  - Verified this by leaving the fields empty and noting that the form would not submit.
